            <p class="a09-result__content-preview display-Proxima">With the dynamics of ensuring user experience for web applications constantly evolving, IT groups must continually review how they deliver business applications. In 2017, several factors have resulted in infrastructure and application architecture changes that depreciate front-end optimization technologies originally developed 5–10 years ago. Today, ensuring that the web server/client infrastructure is aligned to HTTP/2 is the most important step toward helping organizations deliver critical applications faster and more efficiently—while driving an enhanced user experience.</p>

            <p class="a09-result__content-preview display-Proxima">Amazon Web Services (AWS) has become the largest and most prevalent provider of public cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Organizations can now build, test, and deploy entire application stacks without purchasing or reconfiguring on-premises infrastructure. Production applications can benefit from advanced application delivery services such as a web application firewall (WAF), SSL acceleration, content-based routing, load balancing, DDoS mitigation, identity and access management, and protocol agility—which make these key applications go faster, smarter, and safer. For cloud-native AWS deployments, F5 solutions enable simple and easy delivery of these application services to AWS cloud environments.</p>

            <p class="a09-result__content-preview display-Proxima">The pace of the digital economy is speeding up, which means businesses must compete to deliver new services both rapidly and at scale. This requirement has driven organizations to adopt new ways of creating, deploying, and managing applications, which in turn has led to new working practices, new application architectures, and a completely new category of IT infrastructure: the cloud.

While the speed and agility promised by cloud architectures are critical for some applications, the need for stability and resiliency of the core services that underpin business operations remains constant, as does the need for governance and risk management. These competing necessities have split IT between modes of operation and working practices, dividing systems that prioritize stability from those that prioritize agility.

At the heart of this divide seems to be the supposition that these two paradigms are irreconcilable, but what if that were not true? F5 has a unified vision for the provision of services, one that ensures that applications of all kinds stay secure, fast, and highly available.</p>
