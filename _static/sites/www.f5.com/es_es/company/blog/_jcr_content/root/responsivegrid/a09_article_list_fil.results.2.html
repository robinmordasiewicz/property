            <p class="a09-result__content-preview display-Proxima">Companies cite many reasons for why public cloud environments are appealing: scalability, a variety of consumption options that can yield cost savings, and improved agility, to name a few. However, whether an organization is migrating existing applications, building a scaled operation for new applications hosted in the public cloud, or both, the architectural approach taken can make or break the business case.</p>

            <p class="a09-result__content-preview display-Proxima">Even though the adoption of multi-cloud strategies in the public sector space is growing, there remains a gap in effective solutions that address the many challenges faced by the agencies executing on them. One such challenge is the secure interconnection of workloads hosted across multiple providers, which F5&#39;s approach to distributed cloud seeks to address.</p>
