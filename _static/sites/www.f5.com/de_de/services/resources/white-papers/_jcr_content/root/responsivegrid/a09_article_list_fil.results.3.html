            <p class="a09-result__content-preview display-Proxima">Traditional application delivery has focused on how to manage the network for applications. F5 iApps are a revolutionary new way of focusing on how to manage application delivery through the network, thereby changing how applications are delivered across the data center.</p>

            <p class="a09-result__content-preview display-Proxima">Operations teams are expected to manage increasingly complex, heterogeneous environments while meeting enterprise-class service levels for application delivery. DevOps best practices enable applications to scale rapidly and efficiently without costly manual interventions. The F5 and Puppet joint solution provides the functionality for operations teams to deploy, automate, and manage the configuration of an entire application infrastructure stack. This gives application developers the ability to elastically expand and contract infrastructure resources, automate application tests, and reduce application development time frames.</p>

            <p class="a09-result__content-preview display-Proxima">As load balancers continue evolving into today&#39;s Application Delivery Controllers, it&#39;s easy to forget the basic problem for which load balancers were originally created—producing highly available, scalable, and predictable application services. Intelligent application routing, virtualized application services, and shared infrastructure deployments of ADCs can obscure these original goals—but it&#39;s still critical to understand the fundamental role load balancing plays in ADCs.</p>

            <p class="a09-result__content-preview display-Proxima">With the dynamics of ensuring user experience for web applications constantly evolving, IT groups must continually review how they deliver business applications. In 2017, several factors have resulted in infrastructure and application architecture changes that depreciate front-end optimization technologies originally developed 5–10 years ago. Today, ensuring that the web server/client infrastructure is aligned to HTTP/2 is the most important step toward helping organizations deliver critical applications faster and more efficiently—while driving an enhanced user experience.</p>
