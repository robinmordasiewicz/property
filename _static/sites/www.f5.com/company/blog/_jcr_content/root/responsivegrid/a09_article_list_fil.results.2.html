            <p class="a09-result__content-preview display-Proxima">Companies cite many reasons for why public cloud environments are appealing: scalability, a variety of consumption options that can yield cost savings, and improved agility, to name a few. However, whether an organization is migrating existing applications, building a scaled operation for new applications hosted in the public cloud, or both, the architectural approach taken can make or break the business case.</p>

One such challenge is the secure interconnection of workloads hosted across multiple providers, which F5&#39;s approach to distributed cloud seeks to address.</p>
